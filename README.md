# 👋

I'm Jenil, a developer based out of 🇮🇳 (previously SF 🇺🇸). I believe in building minimal, well-designed and simplistic products. Lately, I've been reading a lot of neuroscience and occasionally writing about finance on my [blog](https://jenil.substack.com/p/coming-soon). I've spent the past few years pursuing research on [crypto](https://github.com/jenil04/token-reward-protocol), and understanding the idea of trust.

## Fun facts ⚡️

- I'm a professional table-tennis 🏓 player (former north-west champion in 🇮🇳).
- I'm an open water diver 🏊 🌊 and occasionally like to go surfing 🏄.
